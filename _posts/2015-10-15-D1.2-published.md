Deliverable 1.1 has been published. In this demonstrator deliverable, we describe the data structure definition for public budget data using the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary to be used in OpenBudgets.eu. The definition contains core properties and code lists to be reused across multiple budget datasets and a way to include new properties and datasets as needed. We demonstrate the usage of the definition on a sample of the budget of the European Union.
